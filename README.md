## 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on accurately predicting crop yields using machine learning techniques, based on a comprehensive tutorial. The model leverages historical agricultural data, weather patterns, and soil characteristics to assist farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions for planting, harvesting, and resource allocation.

### 🔍 Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and performed feature engineering for optimal model performance.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and analyzed the relationship between yield and influencing factors like rainfall, temperature, and soil quality.
* **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and compared multiple regression models:

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
* **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess performance.
* **Deployment Ready**: Built with scalability in mind; the trained model can be integrated into real-time agricultural platforms.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow (optional for advanced modeling)

### 📌 Use Cases

* Crop yield forecasting for specific regions or seasons
* Agricultural planning and resource management
* Research in agri-tech and smart farming
